# Douglas Engelbart
Doug's digital footprint is rather large and spans 50 years. You can begin by reading his [papers](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/164/126/), from his original proposals from the 1960s to summaries from the 2000s. You can watch [videos](https://archive.org/details/dougengelbartarchives?&sort=-downloads&page=2) of his talks from the ["mother of all demos"](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html) in 1968 to a [2008 tribute at Stanford](https://archive.org/details/StanfordNews2008TributeEngelbart).

## Big Ideas
In this section, I'll try to summarize the big ideas gleaned from Engelbart.

### C Activities
![ABCs of Organizational Improvement](https://dougengelbart.org/images/pubs/papers/augment-132803/132803_01.jpg)

- **A Activities** are the core activities of the business. For Lambda School, that would be teaching classes, sourcing jobs for students, admissions, etc.
- **B Activities** are activities that improve the ability of the company to perform A Activities. For Lambda School, that would be the Product/Engineering squads that work with each organization - they build new systems that 
- **C Activities** are activities that improve our capabilities for improvement. The Lambda School example would be the platform team themselves, building "paved roads" that allows our B Activity Teams to more productively improve their work.

When I engage in "meta-work", it's often "C Activity" work. Also, building a framework like [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) or [Croquet](https://croquet.io) is very much "C Activity".

## References
### Papers
Of all of his papers, the two that have been most recommended to me are:

- The most famous report is a longer [Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework](http://worrydream.com/refs/Engelbart%20-%20Augmenting%20Human%20Intellect.pdf) from October 1962.
	- A useful reference while reading this paper may be [Field Guide to Doug's 1962 Framework Report](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/380).
- A summary of his framework, 40 years later, called [Improving Our Ability to Improve: A Call for Investment in a New Future](http://worrydream.com/refs/Engelbart%20-%20Improving%20Our%20Ability%20to%20Improve.pdf) from September 2003.

Lots of interesting ideas in this talk. May need to watch it a few more times in order to really get it. Need to document more.
