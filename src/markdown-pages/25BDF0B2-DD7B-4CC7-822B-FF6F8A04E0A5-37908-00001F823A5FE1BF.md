# How to Measure Knowledge Work
Knowledge work canâ€™t be measured in hours.

- Productivity between hours for the same person varies by >100x
- Knowledge work can have negative productivity (destructive)
- Productivity between individuals varies tremendously 
- Each hour of work you are bringing:
	- Your entire career of work, to this point knowledge work is broad, not narrowly focused
	- Your context on this project / task - knowledge work is context-dependent
	- Your skill and experience with this specific task
