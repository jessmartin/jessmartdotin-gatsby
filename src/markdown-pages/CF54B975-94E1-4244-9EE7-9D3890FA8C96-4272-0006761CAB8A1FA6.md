# Reinventing the Book
> Books are incredible *repositories for information*, but *terrible tools for learning*. 

The lie is that if you read a book, you will learn the knowledge contained in the book. This is not the case. In order to truly learn from a book, you have to apply additional learning techniques on top of the book.

What if there were a new medium for interacting with knowledge that was better than a book for relaying knowledge?

We would probably want to represent knowledge differently (see [Knowledge Representation](/notes/AE1554A0-EC67-4063-911D-334B8BEB0085-1675-0000E70184C1E679)).

## A History
What follows is a partial history of ideas about how to invent a better medium for learning than the book.

- [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [Memex](http://worrydream.com/refs/Bush%20-%20As%20We%20May%20Think%20(Life%20Magazine%209-10-1945).pdf) from 1945 was the backdrop for Engelbart and Alan Kay.
- [Douglas Engelbart](/notes/8D7E575B-5699-42BE-A4F7-C970EE22DB9F-827-000038C22758F9C2)'s Augmenting Human Intelligence is an important backdrop to _everything_, but it's a bit inaccessible. Engelbart is probably a Level 6 or 7 (see [[The 7 Levels of Work]]) and had a hard time connecting and explaining his ideas.
- [Alan Kay](/notes/F7A99B45-9A81-465E-A37D-CCE5727FC7D5-5164-000033B694E4BB30) is the bridge from Engelbart and Bush's ideas to the present ideas explored by Victor, Matuschak, and Nielsen. He pioneered the Dynabook.
	- Here's Alan giving an [oral history of the Dynabook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwL3yXdupv0). It's about 2 hours, but worth the watch. It will take you through parts of [[The Dream Machine]] as well.
	- The Learning Research Group at Xeroc PARC did some work as well.
		- Adele Goldberg and Alan Kay's [Personal Dynamic Media - 1977](http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/refs/Kay1977.pdf)
- Bret Victor is the next important figure.
	- He has done research and prototyping on [Explorable Explanations](http://worrydream.com/#!/ExplorableExplanations).
	- Here's an example of an interactive essay he put together [Simulation as a Practical Tool](http://worrydream.com/#!/SimulationAsAPracticalTool).
	- To see more examples, watch his talk on [Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](http://worrydream.com/#!/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable)
- Andy Matuschak has written a great summary article [Why books donâ€™t work | Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/books/)
- See Andy's notes on his approach to solving the problem, what he calls the Mnemonic Medium:
	- [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF)
	- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)
- Michael Nielsen has done some thinking on this:
	- [Thought as a Technology](http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/index.html)
	- [Toward an exploratory medium for mathematics](http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/emm.html)
- Andy and Michael collaborated on [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/), which is a mnemonic medium "textbook" for learning the basics of Quantum Computing.
	- They wrote about their learnings from this project in the paper [How can we develop transformative tools for thought?](/notes/20E186CF-BDF2-4143-8B94-69ECABD3E7B0-951-000059BBE372F180)
