# The Work I'm Looking For

**TL;DR:** _I'm available for consulting engagements with companies working on agent-based AI systems. I work on an hourly or per-project basis, bringing two decades of software development and product experience to help teams navigate from concept to shipped product._

## What I Do

With nearly 20 years of shipping software professionally, I help teams tackle the complex challenges of building AI-enabled products:

- Guide projects from ideation through shipping
- Lead customer discovery and validate demand prior to building
- Execute technical spikes to validate critical assumptions
- Make architectural decisions that balance innovation with practicality
- Design prototypes and conduct UX testing
- Plan and execute initial product launches
- Create technical documentation and educational content

## Experience

My work combines practical business experience with deep technical expertise.

### Zero to One
- Built dozens of early-stage prototypes and products through consulting and venture studios
- Co-founded First, an ML-enabled CRM for real estate agents (acquired by Remax)
- Co-founded Ranger, an uptime monitoring service (acquired by Rackspace)

### Me and AI

I've worked with "AI" on-and-off for over twenty years during various phases of the technology.

- **2024:** I recently co-founded [Next LX](https://nextlx.com) an AI-powered workplace simulator for training.
- **2014-2019:** As a co-founder of First, we built a machine learning platform for predicting which client a real estate should work with next and designed a consumer-like CRM experience around it.
- **2003-2006:** I designed an agent-based AI framework in 2003 (no joke!) and did graduate research in procedural content generation.

If you're building agent-based AI systems and need help with any aspect of the journey from concept to shipped product, let's talk. Contact me at jessmartin@gmail.com or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jessmartin).
