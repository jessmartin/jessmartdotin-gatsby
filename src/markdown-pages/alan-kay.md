# Learning from Alan Kay
## Summary of Alan's Thoughts
### A Critique of Modern Computing
Alan Kay participated in the foundational age of modern computing. He worked with the computing pioneers who were making the breakthroughs in physics, cognitive psychology, information theory, mathematics, and computer science. He built systems and brought them to life for the first time. He witnessed the adoption of the computer in the commercial and eventually the consumer space.

But perhaps more importantly, Alan was one of the casters of the original vision of modern computing. He saw what could be. Having seen what has come of computing so far, his main message is: we can do better. We must do better. Humanity depends on it.

The original vision for modern computing, espoused by Doug Engelbart but also widely shared by those at PARC, was: "The destiny of computers is to become interactive intellectual multipliers for all humanity, all networked and working together."

And what we have today instead is Candy Crush.

Alan shares several reasons for why we got here and also an antidote. We can still "take the blue pill", shake off this mortal coil, and refocus our aim on greater feats.

**Alan's reasoning for why computing has seen little fundamental innovation:**
- The industrial revolution 
	- makes it possible to extract tremendous profit from serving the center of the bell curve.
	- most "middle of the bell curve" solutions are derivative, not transformative.
- Humanity's flawed thinking capacity
	- Unfortunately, most of us identify perception with reality. We don't think critically about what we receive. We're satisfied with far less than we should be.
- Computing is largely driven by fad, unlike science
	- The hard sciences have hard limits - physics and math and the like - and thus are not (as much) driven by fad.
	- Computing, on the other hand, is synthetic. There are fewer hard limits. Thus, computing in general is heavily susceptible to fad and popularity. Why does one programming language win over another, for example?
- Communities of science doing foundational science research have disappeared
	- There used to be far more funding available for doing scientific research. This was partly due to the times (WWII and the Cold War) and partly due to the what the government chooses to invest in.

**How do we get back to doing transformative work at the "edges of computing"?**
- Study the computing pioneers and learn to see their vision
- Start thinking from first principles
- Focus on research over engineering
- Learn to see what's wrong with the systems around you
- Rebuild the communities of science

## Alan's Big Ideas

- Replicated computing
- Objects as virtual machines

### Raw Conversation Notes

_Warning:_ These notes are completely stream-of-consciousness based on a 3 hour conversation with Kay. They are almost entirely unedited and will probably provoke useful thought for me alone.

- ARPA dozens of inventions
	- NSF - Henry Fuchs - helped him to get started in grad school
		- 70s
	- The oldest one - in my 30s
- How we used to do it in the old ways
	- Find the "Elephant graveyards" - we had some good stuff back in the old days!
	- On Realtime Collaborative Spaces - 
		- Avoid words - words express categories
			- Don't take any problem out of your "current context"
			- Don't make up a word for what it is you're going to do
			- Vague idea
				- Write down 10 things about it
	- Use paper to get rid of most of my ideas
		- Most ideas are mediocre down to bad
			- Don't get fascinated by an idea! This is what kills people!
			- Most people are happy to have an idea.
		- Really good ideas // great ideas are extremely rare
			- Not worth working on things that aren't great
	- ARPA
		- I was taught all of this when I stumbled into grad school in my 30's
		- Flew 140k miles as a student at ARPA
			- Keep on visiting - deliver messages - MIT <- -> Utah
		- Get to know everyone who's doing edge of the art stuff
			- PHD student at ARPA was a full-fledged researcher - not treated
		- What energized all of this stuff: not trying to make money.
			- Making money was one of the last things that people should be worried.
			- But now we have to be worried about making money, particularly if you live in the valley. Inflation is crushing. Inflation in RE alone is 10x.
	- How to do research?
		- Industrial revolution allows selling of conveniences the middle of the bell curve.
		- So much money to be made selling to the middle of the bell curve.
	- The pop culture has moved in.
	- Couple of impulses
		- The WAY we did things
			- 40's, 50's - existential threat!

		- The big problem is humans have brains. (the 4 idols we worship)
			- Genetics - 
			- Culture - 
			- Language - 
			- Academia - 
		- What humans do instead is gather up heuristics - methods - help us to get around what's wrong with our thinking
			- One of those heuristics is community - science is a community
				- The [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society) initiated this community - invented in London in 1660
					- About 25 years after Bacon's book
					- 3 years after Newton was born
		- Our brains weren't set up to think and reason well - nor were languages
		- [Cognitive biases page from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#:~:text=Cognitive%20biases%20are%20systematic%20patterns,in%20psychology%20and%20behavioral%20economics.&text=Explanations%20include%20information%2Dprocessing%20rules,to%20produce%20decisions%20or%20judgments.)
