    <h2>How I Help</h2>

    <p>
      I specialize in building web and mobile products, focusing on the
      full-stack. I'm skilled at all phases of product development, with
      particular experience in navigating the difficult, uncertain beginning
      phase. I'm well-suited to help build:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prototypes</li>
      <li>First versions</li>
      <li>Architecture overhauls</li>
      <li>Re-writes</li>
      <li>Dramatic new features</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're not exactly sure what needs to be built, I can help with that,
      too. I can assist with the planning conversations, facilitate discussions
      around trade-offs and suggest creative solutions that help more quickly
      accomplish the project's goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love collaborating with teams and I'm also comfortable with building all
      aspects of the project myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I have very broad experience, I focus on a few technologies that
      allow me to provide maximum value:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, etc)</li>
      <li>React or JQuery javascript front-ends</li>
      <li>React Native for mobile apps</li>
    </ul>
