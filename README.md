  The Personal Website of Jess Martin
</h1>

This is where Jess stores his ramblings, his rants, and his radical project work.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start the server.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: This also starts up a GraphQL browser at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool to experiment with querying the data.\_

## Workshop Edition

![Workshop Edition](https://jessmart.in/images/webpage-layout.png)

I'm revamping my website to be more like a workshop where you can come and experience my work interactively and collaboratively.

The base website is one giant image linked to various areas by an imagemap.

Working on making it more interactive!
