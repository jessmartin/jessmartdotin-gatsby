  The Personal Website of Jess Martin
</h1>

This is where Jess stores his ramblings, his rants, and his radical project work.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start the server.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.\_
